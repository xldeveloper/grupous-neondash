## Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Design Philosophy Creation

Create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:

- Form, space, color, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

**Philosophy Structure:**

1. **Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence"
2. **Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) emphasizing:
   - Space and form
   - Color and material
   - Scale and rhythm
   - Composition and balance
   - Expert craftsmanship

### Step 2: Canvas Creation

Express the philosophy visually. Create museum/magazine quality work.

---

## Philosophy Examples

**"Concrete Poetry"**
Massive color blocks, sculptural typography, Brutalist spatial divisions. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension.

**"Chromatic Language"**
Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal, chromatic fields communicate.

**"Analog Meditation"**
Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Japanese photobook aesthetic.

**"Organic Systems"**
Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature. Information through visual diagrams.

**"Geometric Silence"**
Grid-based precision, bold photography, dramatic negative space. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty.

## Canvas Creation Guidelines

### Visual Quality Standards

- Treat design as if it were a scientific bible
- Dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements
- Sparse, clinical typography
- Limited, cohesive color palette
- Analytical visual language for human experience

### Text as Visual Element

- Text is always minimal and visual-first
- Context guides scale (bold for punk, whisper for ceramics)
- Nothing falls off the page, nothing overlaps
- All elements contained within canvas with proper margins
- Professional execution is non-negotiable

### Typography

Use fonts from `assets/canvas-fonts/` (81 font files available).

Get creative by making typography part of the art itself — if abstract, bring the font onto the canvas, not typeset digitally.

## Essential Principles

- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview
- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element
- **SPATIAL EXPRESSION**: Ideas through space, form, color, composition
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: Interpret visually with creative room
- **PURE DESIGN**: Art objects, not documents with decoration
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Meticulously crafted, labored over with care

---

## Output Format

Single downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy as .md file.

---

## Multi-Page Option

When requested:

- Create additional pages along the same design philosophy
- Each page distinctly different but cohesive
- Bundle in same PDF or multiple PNGs
- Treat as pages in a coffee table book
- Exercise full creative freedom
