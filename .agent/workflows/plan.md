# /plan - Master Planning Command

$ARGUMENTS

---

## 🔴 MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

> [!CAUTION]
> **HARD REQUIREMENTS** - These are NOT optional:

1. **ACTIVATE SKILL FIRST**: Read `.agent/skills/planning/SKILL.md` before anything
2. **EXECUTE APEX RESEARCH**: Complete ALL 4 phases of research cascade
3. **CREATE PLAN FILE**: `docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md` is MANDATORY output
4. **NO CODE WRITING**: This command creates plan file ONLY
5. **R.P.I.V WORKFLOW**: Research → Plan → (skip Implement) → Validate
6. **SOCRATIC GATE**: Ask clarifying questions if request is unclear
7. **ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION**: All tasks must have subtasks with validation

---

## Skills to Activate

| Priority | Skill                             | Purpose                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| P0       | `.agent/skills/planning/SKILL.md` | Core R.P.I.V methodology     |
| P1       | APEX Research Protocol (below)    | Advanced multi-source search |

**MANDATORY**: Read `.agent/skills/planning/SKILL.md` FIRST, then apply APEX Research Protocol.

## APEX Research Protocol

### Phase 0: Search Planning

Before executing any search:

```yaml
SEARCH_CONTEXT:
  objectives: [Clear information needs from user request]
  quality_criteria: [Precision > 90%, relevance, authority]
  source_constraints: [Official docs first, then web if insufficient]
  coverage_expectations: [Comprehensive for L4+ tasks]
```

### Research Cascade (Strict Order)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  APEX RESEARCH CASCADE (execute in order)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. LOCAL CODEBASE (patterns, conventions)                      │
│     └─→ grep_search, view_file, list_dir                        │
│     └─→ Document: file_structure, naming, error_handling        │
│                                                                  │
│  2. CONTEXT7 (official documentation)                           │
│     └─→ resolve-library-id → query-docs                         │
│     └─→ Document: API patterns, best practices, constraints     │
│                                                                  │
│  3. TAVILY (web search) - ONLY if 1 and 2 insufficient          │
│     └─→ tavily-search with specific query                       │
│     └─→ tavily-extract for promising URLs                       │
│     └─→ Document: latest patterns, edge cases, security         │
│                                                                  │
│  4. SEQUENTIAL THINKING (synthesis + decision)                  │
│     └─→ Combine all sources                                     │
│     └─→ Analyze trade-offs                                      │
│     └─→ Define approach with confidence score                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Search Quality Metrics

| Metric     | Target     | Validation                          |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Precision  | > 90%      | Findings directly answer objectives |
| Coverage   | Complete   | All major aspects researched        |
| Sources    | ≥ 3 types  | Codebase + docs + web/synthesis     |
| Confidence | 4-5 / 5    | Each finding rated                  |
| Edge Cases | ≥ 5 for L4 | Documented failure modes            |

### Research Outputs (Required)

```yaml
RESEARCH_DELIVERABLES:
  findings_table:
    format: "| # | Finding | Confidence (1-5) | Source | Impact |"
    minimum_entries: 5

  knowledge_gaps:
    description: "What remains unknown after research"
    action: "Document for Phase 1 or ask user"

  assumptions_to_validate:
    description: "Explicit assumptions requiring confirmation"
    action: "Mark in plan for validation during implementation"

  edge_cases:
    description: "Potential failure modes and boundary conditions"
    minimum: 5 (for L4+ complexity)

  source_quality:
    authoritative: "Official docs, official repos"
    verified: "Cross-referenced across 2+ sources"
    current: "Published within last 12 months preferred"
```

## 🔴 MANDATORY: Plan File Creation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **YOU MUST CREATE THE PLAN FILE BEFORE FINISHING**
>
> The plan file `docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md` is the PRIMARY deliverable.
> Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT just summarize in chat.
> The file MUST exist in the `docs/` folder.

### Plan File Template (REQUIRED STRUCTURE)

```markdown
# PLAN-{task-slug}: {Title}

> **Goal:** {One-line description of the objective}

## 0. Research Findings

| # | Finding | Confidence | Source | Impact |
|---|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | ... | X/5 | ... | ... |

### Knowledge Gaps & Assumptions
- **Gap:** {What remains unknown}
- **Assumption:** {What we're assuming to be true}

---

## 1. User Review Required (If Any)

---

## 2. Proposed Changes

### Phase N: {Phase Name}

#### [MODIFY/NEW/DELETE] [filename](file:///absolute/path)
- **Action:** {What will be done}

## Task Execution

```yaml
CONTEXT:
  user_request: $ARGUMENTS
  mode: CONSERVATIVE (plan only, no code)
  output_location: docs/PLAN-{task-slug}.md

WORKFLOW:
  0. CLASSIFY:
     - Determine complexity level (L1-L10)
     - If L4+: Execute APEX Research Protocol fully

     - Codebase: patterns, conventions, existing implementations
     - Context7: official docs for all technologies involved
     - Tavily: best practices, security, edge cases (if needed)
     - Sequential Thinking: synthesize and decide approach

  2. PLAN:
     - Create Findings Table with confidence scores
     - List Knowledge Gaps explicitly
     - List Assumptions to Validate
     - Decompose into Atomic Tasks (AT-XXX)
     - MANDATORY: Each AT-XXX has Subtasks (ST-XXX.N)
     - Define validation commands + rollback steps
     - Mark parallel-safe tasks with ⚡

  3. OUTPUT (MANDATORY):
     ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
     │  ⚠️ CRITICAL: CREATE THE FILE IN docs/                  │
     │                                                         │

     │  DO NOT just respond in chat.                          │
     │  The file IS the deliverable.                          │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     - Include all research artifacts
     - Mark parallel-safe tasks with ⚡
     - Include pre-submission checklist

NAMING_RULES:

> **MANDATORY VALIDATION BEFORE COMPLETION:**
> 1. Verify `docs/PLAN-{slug}.md` file exists
> 2. Verify all AT-XXX tasks have ST-XXX.N subtasks
> 3. Verify findings table has 5+ entries

Tell user:

```
✅ Plan created: docs/PLAN-{slug}.md

Research Summary:
- Sources consulted: [count]
- Findings documented: [count]
- Confidence level: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- Knowledge gaps: [count] (if any)
