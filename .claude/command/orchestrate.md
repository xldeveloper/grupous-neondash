# Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are now in **ORCHESTRATION MODE**. Your task: coordinate specialized agents to solve this complex problem.

## Task to Orchestrate

$ARGUMENTS

---

## CRITICAL: Minimum Agent Requirement

> **ORCHESTRATION = MINIMUM 3 DIFFERENT AGENTS**
>
> If you use fewer than 3 agents, you are NOT orchestrating - you're just delegating.
>
> **Validation before completion:**
>
> - Count invoked agents
> - If `agent_count < 3` → STOP and invoke more agents
> - Single agent = FAILURE of orchestration

### Agent Selection Matrix

| Task Type      | REQUIRED Agents (minimum)                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web App**    | frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, test-engineer                    |
| **API**        | backend-specialist, security-auditor, test-engineer                       |
| **UI/Design**  | frontend-specialist, seo-specialist, performance-optimizer                |
| **Database**   | database-architect, backend-specialist, security-auditor                  |
| **Full Stack** | project-planner, frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, devops-engineer |
| **Debug**      | debugger, explorer-agent, test-engineer                                   |
| **Security**   | security-auditor, penetration-tester, devops-engineer                     |

## Pre-Flight: Mode Check

| Current Mode | Task Type          | Action                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **plan**     | Any                | Proceed with planning-first approach                         |
| **edit**     | Simple execution   | Proceed directly                                             |
| **edit**     | Complex/multi-file | Ask: "This task requires planning. Switch to plan mode?"     |
| **ask**      | Any                | Ask: "Ready to orchestrate. Switch to edit or plan mode?"    |

## STRICT 2-PHASE ORCHESTRATION

### PHASE 1: PLANNING (Sequential - NO parallel agents)

| Step | Agent                       | Action                       |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1    | `project-planner`           | Create docs/PLAN.md          |
| 2    | (optional) `explorer-agent` | Codebase discovery if needed |

> **NO OTHER AGENTS during planning!** Only project-planner and explorer-agent.

### CHECKPOINT: User Approval

```
After PLAN.md is complete, ASK:

"Plan created: docs/PLAN.md

Do you approve? (Y/N)
- Y: Implementation will start
- N: I will revise the plan"
```

> **DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 without explicit user approval!**

### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Parallel agents after approval)

| Parallel Group | Agents                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Foundation     | `database-architect`, `security-auditor`    |
| Core           | `backend-specialist`, `frontend-specialist` |
| Polish         | `test-engineer`, `devops-engineer`          |

> After user approval, invoke multiple agents in PARALLEL.

## Available Agents (17 total)

## Orchestration Protocol

### Step 1: Analyze Task Domains

Identify ALL domains this task touches:

```
□ Security     → security-auditor, penetration-tester
□ Backend/API  → backend-specialist
□ Frontend/UI  → frontend-specialist
□ Database     → database-architect
□ Testing      → test-engineer
□ DevOps       → devops-engineer
□ Mobile       → mobile-developer
□ Performance  → performance-optimizer
□ SEO          → seo-specialist
□ Planning     → project-planner
```

### Step 2: Phase Detection

| If Plan Exists                     | Action                           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| NO `docs/PLAN.md`                  | → Go to PHASE 1 (planning only)  |
| YES `docs/PLAN.md` + user approved | → Go to PHASE 2 (implementation) |

### Step 3: Execute Based on Phase

**PHASE 1 (Planning):**

```
Use the project-planner agent to create PLAN.md
→ STOP after plan is created
→ ASK user for approval
```

**PHASE 2 (Implementation - after approval):**

```
Invoke agents in PARALLEL:
Use the frontend-specialist agent to [task]
Use the backend-specialist agent to [task]
Use the test-engineer agent to [task]
```

**CRITICAL: Context Passing (MANDATORY)**

When invoking ANY subagent, you MUST include:

1. **Original User Request:** Full text of what user asked
2. **Decisions Made:** All user answers to Socratic questions
3. **Previous Agent Work:** Summary of what previous agents did
4. **Current Plan State:** If `~/.claude/plans/` has a plan, include it

**Example with FULL context:**

```
Use the project-planner agent to create PLAN.md:

**CONTEXT:**
- User Request: "Social platform for students, with mock data"
- Decisions: Tech=Vue 3, Layout=Grid Widget, Auth=Mock, Design=Young Dynamic
- Previous Work: Orchestrator asked 6 questions, user chose all options
- Current Plan: ~/.claude/plans/playful-roaming-dream.md exists with initial structure

**TASK:** Create detailed PLAN.md based on ABOVE decisions. Do NOT infer from folder name.
```

> **VIOLATION:** Invoking subagent without full context = subagent will make wrong assumptions!

### Step 4: Verification (MANDATORY)

The LAST agent must run appropriate verification scripts:

```bash
python ~/.claude/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .
python ~/.claude/skills/lint-and-validate/scripts/lint_runner.py .
```

### Step 5: Synthesize Results

Combine all agent outputs into unified report.

| 2   | frontend-specialist | UI implementation    | Done   |
| 3   | test-engineer       | Verification scripts | Done   |

### Verification Scripts Executed

- [x] security_scan.py → Pass/Fail
- [x] lint_runner.py → Pass/Fail

### Key Findings

1. **[Agent 1]**: Finding
2. **[Agent 2]**: Finding
3. **[Agent 3]**: Finding

### Deliverables

- [ ] PLAN.md created
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Scripts verified

## EXIT GATE

Before completing orchestration, verify:

1. **Agent Count:** `invoked_agents >= 3`
2. **Scripts Executed:** At least `security_scan.py` ran
3. **Report Generated:** Orchestration Report with all agents listed

> **If any check fails → DO NOT mark orchestration complete. Invoke more agents or run scripts.**

---

**Begin orchestration now. Select 3+ agents, execute sequentially, run verification scripts, synthesize results.**
